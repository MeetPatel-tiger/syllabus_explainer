# Why did I create this?

- I always felt like reading syllabus is so boring and time consuming. I asked other people whether they read their syllabi or not, they said no. This is then when I thought about making this website!
---

SyllabusExplainer is a simple web app that helps students quickly understand their course syllabi.  
You can upload an image or PDF of your syllabus, and the app will **read it using OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** and **summarize the important parts** using Google‚Äôs **Gemini AI API**.

It‚Äôs built to save students time, instead of reading through pages of text, you get a short, clear summary of grading, deadlines, and key topics in seconds.(I am working on improvements)

##  What It Does

- üñºÔ∏è Reads text from syllabus images or PDFs  
- üí¨ Summarizes key information in plain English  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Uses a Flask backend to handle the processing  
- üåê Simple and clean Reactfrontend  


---

## How It Works

1. Upload syllabus file (.jpg, .png, or .pdf)  
2. The Flask backend uses **Tesseract OCR** to extract the text  
3. That text is sent to **Gemini AI**, which summarizes it  
4. The summary appears instantly on the website
